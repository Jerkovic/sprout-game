Texture bleeding (fixed)
Takes a heavily-packed sprite sheet with no padding between sprites/tiles and adds padding or spacing.
Can also create a "gutter" around seamless tiles, filling the padding with the tile's edge pixels, preventing seams
from appearing when using the tile in a 3D rendering environment due to interpolation.
